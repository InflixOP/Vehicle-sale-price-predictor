# Predicting the Sales Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

## Overview:

This project involves predicting the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the future sale price of a bulldozer based on its characteristics and historical sales data.

## 1. Problem Definition:

The problem is defined as predicting the future sale price of a bulldozer given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.

## 2. Data:

The data for this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed from the following link:

The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on its usage, equipment type, and configuration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

## 3. Model Training:

Various machine learning models are trained using the dataset to learn patterns and make predictions about the sale price of bulldozers.

## 4. Model Evaluation:

The performance of the trained models is assessed using problem-specific evaluation metrics to determine their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant measures.

## 5. Model Comparison:

Different models are compared to identify the most effective one in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization.

## 6. Model Fine-Tuning:

Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection are applied to improve the performance of the chosen model further.

## 7. Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this project is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices. This metric measures the accuracy of the predictions relative to the actual sale prices.

## 8. Features:

Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing the features of the dataset. You can find the data dictionary at the following link:
