# Predicting the Sales Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

## Overview:

This project involves predicting the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the future sale price of a bulldozer based on its characteristics and historical sales data.

## 1. Problem Definition:

The problem is defined as predicting the future sale price of a bulldozer given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.

## 2. Data:

The data for this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed from the following link:

[Bluebook for Bulldozers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)

The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on its usage, equipment type, and configuration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

## 3. Model Training:

Various machine learning models are trained using the dataset to learn patterns and make predictions about the sale price of bulldozers.

## 4. Model Evaluation:

The performance of the trained models is assessed using problem-specific evaluation metrics to determine their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant measures.

## 5. Model Comparison:

Different models are compared to identify the most effective one in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization.

## 6. Model Fine-Tuning:

Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection are applied to improve the performance of the chosen model further.

## 7. Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this project is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices. This metric measures the accuracy of the predictions relative to the actual sale prices.

## 8. Features:

Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing the features of the dataset. You can find the data dictionary at the following link:

## Environment Setup

To replicate the environment for running this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Miniconda:**
   - Go to the [Miniconda Downloads page](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).
   - Download the appropriate version (32- or 64-Bit) of Miniconda for your operating system.
   - Double click on the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation prompts.
   - Read and agree to the licensing terms.
   - Select the installation location. By default, Anaconda should try to install in your home directory. It's recommended to accept this default.
   - Do not add Anaconda to the PATH environment variable unless necessary, as it can interfere with other software.
   - Complete the installation process.

2. **Create a Conda Environment:**
   - Open the Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3) from the Start Menu or search for it.
   - Create a new Conda environment by running the following command:
     ```
     conda create --name vehicle-sales-env
     ```
   - Activate the environment using the following command:
     ```
     conda activate vehicle-sales-env
     ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   - In the activated Conda environment, install Jupyter Notebook by running:
     ```
     conda install jupyter
     ```
   - When prompted with 'Proceed ([y]/n)?', type `y` and hit Enter to confirm.

4. **Install Required Packages:**
   - Install necessary Python packages using pip. Run the following commands one by one:
     ```
     pip install pandas
     pip install scikit-learn
     pip install matplotlib
     pip install seaborn
     pip install nltk
     pip install beautifulsoup4
     ```

5. **Verify Installation:**
   - You can check if the packages are installed correctly by starting Python in your Anaconda Prompt:
     ```
     python
     ```
   - Import each package on a separate line or take a shortcut and import them all at once:
     ```
     import pandas
     import sklearn
     import matplotlib
     import seaborn
     import nltk
     import bs4
     ```

6. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Once all packages are installed, launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - A Jupyter Notebook interface will open in your default web browser, allowing you to navigate to the project directory and start working on the project.

By following these steps, you'll have set up a virtual environment with all the necessary dependencies to run the vehicle sales prediction project.

## Conclusion:

In this project, we successfully developed a machine learning model to predict the sale price of bulldozers based on their characteristics and historical sales data. We followed a systematic approach that included data exploration, model training, evaluation, comparison, and fine-tuning.

Through the process of model training, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms and techniques to find the most effective model for the task. We evaluated the models using the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) metric, which provided insights into the accuracy and performance of the predictions.

After comparing different models, we identified the most accurate and generalizable one and further refined its performance through fine-tuning techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting the sale price of heavy equipment like bulldozers. The developed model can be valuable for auctioneers, equipment sellers, and buyers in making informed decisions about pricing and purchasing bulldozers.
